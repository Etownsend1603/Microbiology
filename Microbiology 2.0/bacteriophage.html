<h1 style="color: #9D29F3;" class="text">Bacteriophages</h1>
<p class="text" style="font-size: 22px;">A phage is a virus. The face of it has 20 faces and 30 edges making it an icosahedron. The head contains the phage DNA part of the virus. Then there is the tail that is connected to fiber legs.  There are more phages (viruses) on earth than other organisms, including bacteria, and there are billions of bacteria particles on everything. Phages only kill bacteria and ocean bacteria. But like many viruses, phages need a ‘host’ to survive. Usually, phages only choose one type of bacteria to kill, and many of its closest relative. When it finds its victim, it uses its fiber legs with receptors and injects a syringe to keep on the surface.  The phage squeezes it tail and injects its genetic information and in minutes, it has taken over and the genetic information turns into more phages, they stop when the bacteria has been filled up with new phages. They now produce indolizine which is an enzyme that punches a hole in the bacteria.  The pressure gets so high that the bacteria somehow ‘vomits’ all of its insides and dies. The new phages are now free, and the cycle repeats itself with the other phages. <br><br>Humans have been desperate and have been injecting phages into humans and we screwed up. But that was back then, we have yet found and made something called antibiotics, for example, penicillin. But like us, bacteria is a living thing and evolves. Over time bacteria has become immune to our ‘weapons’ and we have created something called superbugs and they are immune to almost everything we have. Us humans are immune to phages; we are just so different. </p>
